    <p style="background-color: blueviolet;">The painting has been definitively identified to depict Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo.[9] It is painted in
        oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family, and it is
        believed he later left it in his will to his favored apprentice Sala√¨.[10] It was believed to have been painted
        between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. It was acquired by
        King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic. It has been on permanent display at the
        Louvre in Paris since 1797.[11]</p>

    <p>The Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time
        seen as an ideal for womanhood.[38] The woman sits markedly upright in a "pozzetto" armchair with her arms
        folded, a sign of her reserved posture. Her gaze is fixed on the observer. The woman appears alive to an unusual
        extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines (sfumato). The soft blending creates an
        ambiguous mood "mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners of the eyes".[39]</p>
