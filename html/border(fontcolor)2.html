    <h1>This is the Border project</h1>
    <pre class="mona">he Mona Lisa bears a strong resemblance to many Renaissance depictions of the Virgin Mary, who was at that time
        seen as an ideal for womanhood.[38] The woman      sits markedly upright in a "pozzetto" armchair with her arms
        folded, a sign of her reserved posture. Her gaze is fixed on the observer. The woman appears alive to an unusual
        extent, which Leonardo achieved by his method of not drawing outlines (sfumato). The soft blending creates an
        ambiguous mood "mainly in two features: the corners of the mouth, and the corners       of the eyes".
