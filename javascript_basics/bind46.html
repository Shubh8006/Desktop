<!-- 
The bind() function creates a new bound function. Calling the bound function generally
 results in the execution of the function it wraps, which is also called the target
  function. The bound function will store the parameters passed — which include the value
   of this and the first few arguments — as its internal state. These values are stored in
    advance, instead of being passed at call time. You can generally see const boundFn
     = fn.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2) as being equivalent to const boundFn = (...restArgs) 
     => fn.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...restArgs) for the effect when it's called 
     (but not when boundFn is constructed).
